# predict_Ki-67_from_HE
This is the source code of our paper ["Predict Ki-67 positive cells in H&E-stained images using deep learning independently from IHC-stained images"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2020.00183/full). The dataset for training and evaluation can be downloaded from either one of the following links:
